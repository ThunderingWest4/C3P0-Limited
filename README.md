# C3P0-Limited

Neural Translation - English to Spanish (and vice versa if I can figure that out)

Called C3P0 because, well...

[![6 Million Forms of Communication](http://img.youtube.com/vi/ZdSqrtKQ37E/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdSqrtKQ37E "")

He's familiar in over 6 million forms of communication and translation. I added limited on there because this *won't* be familiar in 6 million forms of communication. To be honest, I'm not sure if 6 million different forms of communication actually exist at the moment. Point being, this network will be familiar in translation between 2 different languages. And sadly, not C3P0

# Install Packages

Using the default thing for pip (making a requirements.txt) didn't really work so instead, I just made a .sh file that runs pip commands to install each package with necessary specifications (i.e. tensorflow-datasets needs specific settings for 2020). I might fix it later but the focus is the ML Translator, not a requirements.txt file
